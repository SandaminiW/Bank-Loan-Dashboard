## Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze the performance and distribution of bank loans over a given period. The dashboard categorizes loan applications into good and bad loans, providing insights into the total number of applications, funded amounts, and amounts received. It tracks key financial indicators such as the average interest rate and debt-to-income ratio (DTI) to assess the health of the loan portfolio. This report aims to help financial institutions monitor loan performance, identify risk areas, and make data-driven decisions to improve loan issuance strategies. By distinguishing between good and bad loans, the bank can better manage credit risk, increase profit margins, and reduce loan defaults.

## KPI's Requirements.

1. Total Loan Applications -: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, It is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date(MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month(MoM).

2. Total Funded Amount -: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. we also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month(MoM) changes in this metric.

3. Total Amount Received -: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Data(MTD) total amount received and observe the Month-over-Month(MoM) changes.

4. Average Interest Rate -: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month(MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.

5. Average Debt-to-income Ratio (DTI) -: Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health.

## Final Conclusion:

The dashboard reveals that the majority (86.18%) of the bank's loans fall under the "Good Loan" category, indicating solid financial health in terms of funding and loan repayment. The total loan applications stand at 38.6k, with a significant proportion being successfully funded. Bad loans represent only 13.82%, but their funded amount still sums to $65.5M, showing potential risk. Fully paid loans account for the largest portion of both funded and received amounts, signaling responsible repayment behavior by most borrowers. However, the charged-off loans, though fewer in number, show higher interest rates (13.88%) and a higher DTI ratio, highlighting the need for stricter approval measures in this category. Overall, the bank's loan performance is positive, but attention should be focused on reducing bad loans to further optimize profit and minimize risk.
